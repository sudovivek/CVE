> [Suggested Description]
>  
>   The Student Study Center Management System V1.0, developed by PHPGurukul, is susceptible to a critical security vulnerability known as Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 
>   This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed by the application. 
>   The underlying issue lies in the system's failure to adequately sanitize and validate user-provided input within the "Admin Name" field on the Admin Profile page, 
>   thereby allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
