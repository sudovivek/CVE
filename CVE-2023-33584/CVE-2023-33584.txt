> [Suggested Description]
>  
>   Enrollment System Project V1.0, developed by Sourcecodester, has been found to be vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI) attacks. 
>   This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. 
>   The system fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the username and password fields during the login process, 
>   enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. By exploiting this vulnerability, 
>   an attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.
